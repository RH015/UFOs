# UFOs

The purpose of the exercise is to be able to consult the most information that Dana has in her database.

By sharing it on the web page, filters were created that disaggregate information on the city, state, country where a UFO has been seen, on the right side are the search engines to be able to access the information in an appropriate manner and this was achieved since by doing a function that would filter the information according to the values established with the id and let variables were created since it was the only time that the variable was created for the element that was going to be filtered.

Finally, one of the drawbacks of the page could be that we do not know which States are mentioned in the database, that is, it would be better to have a list with the countries and States where the information exists, as well as to improve the database so that it does not appear as an “attached” list on the web page.
